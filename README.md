# Module 3 Challenge

## Password Generator including prompts

The goal of this project was to design a password generator that generates passwords based on the criteria they've selected. This app was designed using Javascript. When a user wants to generate a password, a prompt will alert them, asking them the length, font-style, symbols and numbers they want included in the random password. 


## Usage 

This app will be used to generate random passwords based on the user's criterias.
